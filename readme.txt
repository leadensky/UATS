This project is the by-product of a road trip from Salt Lake City to San Francisco I made with my brother, Tim. To break the monotony we decided to do a 12-hour Ruby on Rails hack-a-thon to see if we could get a functional timesheet system created. Tim has a ton more Ruby experience than I do, but not much Rails exposure. I come from a .NET background, and have some exposure to MVC, but fairly limited exposure to Ruby. Basically, this was a learning exercise. We didn't quite finish in the 12 hour window, but learned a lot and will maybe continue to pick away at this as time permits.
